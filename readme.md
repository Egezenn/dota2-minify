## Is this safe to use?

This project has been around for over 3 years with thousands of downloads and users.

No one has ever been banned for these mods. This project strictly deals with VPK modifications and not hacking related things like memory/file manipulation. It is utilizing Valve's approved methods (VPK loading) for creating assets, as documented on the [official Valve Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/VPK). Historically Valve has only disabled assets from loading and never punished modders. The worst thing that can happen is a mod stops working and that's it.
