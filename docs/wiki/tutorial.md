## Installation

Minify is available for Windows, Linux and Mac<sup>1</sup>!

You can download the archives from the link below:

https://egezenn.github.io/dota2-minify

<sup>1</sup>: Only through [running from source](development.md?id=running-from-the-source).

## Running

Extract the contents of the `.zip` file you've downloaded to someplace you like. You can run the `Minify` executable afterwards.

> [!WARNING]
> On Linux you may have to run `chmod +x ./Minify` to grant execution permissions if nothing happens after running the executable.

Select the mods you'd like, the language you want to use and patch!

You can view information about a mod on their respective `Details` page. You can also look at them through [here](https://egezenn.github.io/dota2-minify/mods.html).

After the sound, Steam may restart while Minify is adjusting your Dota2 launch parameters. Then you're good to go!

> [!INFO]
> You may see some mods grayed out/untickable. For these, you need the [Workshop DLC](troubleshooting_faq.md?id=workshop-tools-dlc).

## Installing mods

You can find more mods, tooling and skins at our [website](https://egezenn.github.io/dota2-minify/community.html) or [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/2YDnqpbcKM).
